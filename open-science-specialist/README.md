# Project background[^1]

The traditional academic scientist is judged solely on research
productivity, defined as the number and quality of peer-reviewed papers.
Working on research, submitting papers to peer-reviewed journals, and
reviewing for those same journals, forms the basis of their work. Other
academic outputs, such as science communication as a process, research
software, reproducible research, open science and other non-traditional
outputs, are not widely recognised. Nevertheless, this is slowly
changing, and we can observe that the use of modern tools and approaches
to manage and disseminate information has moved from interesting and
tangentially useful to standard and required.

The modern academic scientist works in the open. They develop research
and code in the open, publish data and code with open source licenses,
and post preprints of their academic work. They still submit to
traditional journals and review for those journals but are selective and
ensure that the practices of their partners and funders are as open and
ethical as their own; in doing so they raise the bar for their
colleagues to emulate such practices. Additionally, the modern scientist
shares their research process in blogs and social media and uses the
same to engage with published work. Open science principles and
reproducible workflows form the base of their research and investing
time and resources for their students to learn and apply these
principles is a core part of their teaching.

However, due to history, an analogue identity and academic culture,
engineers and scientists working internationally have typically shied
away from the computer science and rigorous documentation more often
associated with more innovation-lead disciplines. We aim to change that.

# Job description

We seek an Open Science and Data Skills Program Leader to join the newly
established Global Health Engineering (GHE) Chair led by Elizabeth
Tilley. The Candidate will be responsible for creating and promoting an
open science culture within the Global Health Engineering Chair and
within the discipline, more generally. Important to this role will be
the promotion of open science and data skills among the international
NGOs, practitioners, students, researchers and officials with whom we
work.

The Candidate will be responsible for:

1)  building a safe, diverse, and inclusive global Community of Practice
    that focuses on transitioning from being a novice to being accepted
    as a peer by those who are already community members

2)  designing data science training in varying style
    (e.g. in-person/remote synchronous lectures, asynchronous lectures,
    half-day workshops, multi-day boot camps), with several different
    focus topics (e.g. Data Science with R, SQL, Git/GitHub,
    Reproducible Research, Data Management, Data Storytelling, Website
    Creation) and for a variety of audiences (e.g. graduate students,
    researchers, faculty).

3)  Developing and supporting the population of a GHE-related data-hub
    for available, unreadable, and unavailable data (e.g. government
    reports, billing information, census material, laboratory results,
    etc) for wide-spread use and policy-making

4)  Communicating, documenting and evaluating our research and processes
    through blogs, social media, and other communication channels, and
    practise community outreach with the broader (open) data science
    community. We expect the candidate to advance global engineering
    education by researching the effectiveness and impact of teaching
    and applying modern science competencies and computing within the
    field.

Ultimately, the GHE should be a sector-recognized leader in hosting and
disseminating GHE-related data, as well as an excellence centre in
training and support.

# Your profile

We welcome applicants with:

1.  Experience in developing curriculum, facilitating, coordinating, and
    conducting data science training sessions.
2.  Experience in data science and research computing, including
    programming in one or more research computing languages.
3.  Experience managing and conducting interdisciplinary (research)
    projects in environmental and social sciences, engineering, and
    international development.
4.  A Master’s degree or equivalent, approved qualification in Computer
    Science, Data Science, Engineering, Media and Communication,
    Statistics, Development Studies, or related.
5.  An understanding of the need for reproducible research and open
    science standards.
6.  An understanding of the need for innovative and creative teaching
    strategies that ensure inclusiveness.
7.  A willingness to challenge and change institutional practices that
    present barriers to different groups.
8.  Strong networking and relationship-building skills and an interest
    in building broad collaborations
9.  Experience working in Africa, working with a diverse range of
    stakeholders, and a commitment to increasing the number of African
    scholars
